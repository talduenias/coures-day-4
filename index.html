          <p class="default-spacing">Say you’ve got a <b> &lt;Card /&gt;</b>
            component. It’s highly likely it shouldn’t be butted right up against any other components with no
            spacing around it. That’s true for… pretty much every component. So, how do you handle component spacing in
            a design system?

          <p class="default-spacing">I was just writing in my<a href="#"> “What’s new in since CSS3?” </a>article about
            recent and
            possible
            future changes to CSS colors. It’s weirdly a lot. There are just as many or more new and upcoming ways to
            define
            colors than what we have now. I thought we’d take a really quick look.
          <div class="braek"></div>

          <p> First, a major heads up. This stuff is so complicated. I barely understand it. But here are some aspects:
          </p>
          <div class="braek"></div>
          <ul>

            <li> Before all this upcoming change, we only had RGB as a color model, and everything dealt with that.</li>
            <li>We had different “color spaces” that handled it differently (e.g. the rgb() function mapped that RGB
              color
              model
              as a cube with linear coordinates, the hsl() function mapped that RGB color model as a cylinder) but it
              was
              all
              sRGB gamut.</li>
            <li> With the upcoming changes, we’re getting new color models and (!) we’re getting new functions that map
              that
              color model differently. So I think it’s kind of a double-triple whammy.</li>

          </ul>

          <p class="default-spacing">A custom <a href="#">favicon</a> is a great way to polish a web project. It
            displays on desktop
            browser
            tabs,
            and also inside "save for later" readers, other blog posts linking to your site, and more. Traditionally
            this
            has been done with the .ico file type, but recently browsers have allowed use of <a href="#">SVG</a>, a
            vector format.
